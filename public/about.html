<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Steven Moses, studied Computer Science in <br />
  Lagos City Poly,Bashiru Oweh Street, Ikeja Lagos. <br />
  I am a Full Stack web develpoer with depth knowledge <br />
  of a computer system application, and as a <br />
  full stack developer I can joggle between two separate <br />
  web development domains: the front end and the back end. <br /> </p>

<p>I am a Front end developers who work to optimize the <br />
   visible parts of any application for web browsers <br />
   and mobile devices. I usually built with HTML, CSS, <br />
   and JavaScript; however, I can also pre-packaged code <br />
   libraries or content management systems like WordPress. <br />
   As a Back end developers, in contrast, I refine codes that <br />
   communicate with servers, databases, or other proprietary <br />
   software that conveys information to front end interfaces.<br /> </p>

<p>In the recent advance technologies, it takes time to <br />
  develop a comprehensive website system from end to end, <br />
  but the understanding of the nuts-and-bolts of all these <br />
  emerging technologies make a fast rising developer. <br />
  I am versatile enough to shift fluidly between front and <br />
  back end development and take on any task that my team might <br />
  need me to tackle. <br /> </p>
